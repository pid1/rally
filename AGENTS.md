## About Rally

Rally is a family command center that helps families come together, coordinate their days, and make the most of every opportunity. The tone should be empowering and encouraging—helping families work hard, support each other, and excel at what they do.

### Tone & Language Principles

When generating summaries or writing user-facing content, Rally should:

- **Be encouraging and empowering** - Frame challenges as opportunities
- **Celebrate hard work** - Acknowledge effort and productivity
- **Support coordination** - Help the family work as a team
- **Be proactive** - Suggest ways to make the day successful
- **Show optimism** - Even difficult schedules are framed positively
- **Recognize citizenship** - Acknowledge responsibilities and commitments

**Good examples:**
- "You've got a full day ahead—let's make it count!" 
- "Great opportunity for focused work between 9am-2pm"
- "You're well-positioned to tackle the plumber call and grocery run"

**Avoid:**
- Passive or defeatist language
- Overwhelming the user with problems
- Making schedules sound burdensome
- Being overly formal or corporate

## Development Environment

This project uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh) for reproducible development environments.

## For AI Agents

**CRITICAL**: When working in this repository, follow these rules:

### 1. Dependency Management

This project uses **uv** for all Python dependency management and execution. We do NOT use `pip install -e .` or traditional pip workflows.

❌ **Don't do this:**
```bash
pip install -e .
pip install package-name
python -m module
python script.py
```

✅ **Do this instead:**
```bash
# All Python execution goes through uv
uv run python -m rally.cli
uv run python script.py
uv run ruff check .

# Or better yet, use devenv scripts (see below)
seed
lint
test-generate
```

### 2. Always Use devenv Scripts

❌ **Don't do this:**
```bash
uv run ruff check src/
uv run python -m rally.generator
uv run uvicorn rally.main:app --reload
```

✅ **Do this instead:**
```bash
lint
test-generate
dev
```

**Why:** devenv scripts are the single source of truth. They handle uv invocation correctly and ensure consistency across all environments and developers.

### 3. Use Non-Interactive Commands for Automation

When you need to start services programmatically (in scripts, tests, or automation):

❌ **Don't use interactive commands:**
```bash
dev        # This blocks! Agent will hang
logs       # This follows! Agent will hang
```

✅ **Use background commands:**
```bash
dev-start     # Returns immediately
dev-status    # Check if running
dev-logs      # View output (non-blocking)
dev-stop      # Stop when done
```

### 4. Check Process Status Before Starting

Before starting dev servers:

```bash
dev-status    # Check what's already running
```

If something is already running, you can:
- Use it as-is
- Stop it first: `dev-stop`
- View its logs: `dev-logs`

### 5. View Logs for Errors

After starting background processes:

```bash
dev-start
sleep 2       # Give it time to start
dev-logs      # Check for errors
```

### 6. Working with Docker

For Docker operations, use non-blocking variants:

```bash
# Start container
up

# Check logs (non-blocking)
logs-tail

# Not logs (that follows and blocks)
```

## Example Workflows

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Enter devenv shell
devenv shell

# Run full setup (installs deps, initializes DB)
setup

# Seed database with sample data
seed

# Start development server
dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
install-deps

# Run linting
lint

# Test summary generation
test-generate
```

### Starting Development Server

**Interactive (for humans):**
```bash
dev
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Background (for agents/scripts):**
```bash
dev-start
# Do other work...
dev-logs     # Check output
dev-stop     # Clean up when done
```

### Making Code Changes

```bash
# Make changes to src/rally/

# Check formatting and linting
check

# Or auto-fix issues
lint-fix
format

# Test the changes
test-generate
```

### Deploying with Docker

```bash
# Build image
build

# Start container
up

# Check logs
logs-tail

# Stop container
down
```

## Database Migrations

Rally uses a file-based migration system for database schema changes. All migrations are **idempotent** and run automatically on container startup.

### Migration Files

- `migrate_XXX_description.py` - Individual migration scripts
- `run_migrations.py` - Migration runner (executes all migrations in order)
- `MIGRATIONS.md` - Full migration documentation and patterns

### Running Migrations

**Automatic (Docker):**
Migrations run automatically when the container starts via `entrypoint.sh`

**Manual (Development):**
```bash
# Run all migrations
python3 run_migrations.py

# Run specific migration
python3 migrate_add_due_date.py

# Test idempotency (should succeed twice)
python3 run_migrations.py && python3 run_migrations.py
```

### Creating New Migrations

1. Create `migrate_XXX_description.py` (see `MIGRATIONS.md` for template)
2. Add to `run_migrations.py` migrations list
3. Add to `Dockerfile` COPY commands
4. Test locally with `python3 migrate_XXX_description.py`
5. Deploy (runs automatically on container startup)

**Key principle:** Every migration must be idempotent - safe to run multiple times.

### Navigation
All pages include a navigation bar allowing users to switch between Dashboard, Todos, Dinner Planner, and Settings.

## Configuration

Rally supports two configuration approaches:

1. **Settings UI** (recommended) - Configure LLM provider, API keys, timezone, family members, and calendars through the `/settings` page. Settings are stored in the database.
2. **config.toml** (fallback) - File-based configuration for API keys, calendar URLs, and coordinates. DB settings take precedence when both exist.

Additional context files:
- `context.txt` - Family scheduling context (copy from `context.txt.example`)
- `agent_voice.txt` - AI agent tone/voice profile (copy from `agent_voice.txt.example`)

### Environment Modes

Rally detects environment via `RALLY_ENV` environment variable:

**Development (default):**
- Looks for config files in current directory
- Database at `./rally.db`

**Production:**
- Set via `ENV RALLY_ENV=production` in Dockerfile
- Looks for config in `/data/`
- Database at `/data/rally.db`

In Docker container, these should be mounted at `/data/`:
- `/data/config.toml` (optional if using Settings UI)
- `/data/context.txt`
- `/data/agent_voice.txt`

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
dev-status              # Check what's running
dev-stop                # Stop background processes
# Or kill manually:
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill
```

### Database Issues

```bash
rm rally.db            # Delete database (or data/rally.db in prod)
db-init                # Reinitialize
seed                   # Add sample data for development
```

The database is automatically created when the app starts. Migrations run automatically before initialization. Models include:
- `FamilyMember` - Family members with name, color, and timestamps
- `Calendar` - ICS calendar feeds linked to family members, with optional owner email
- `Setting` - Key-value settings store (LLM provider, API keys, timezone, etc.)
- `DashboardSnapshot` - Stores generated dashboard data with date, timestamp, JSON data, and active flag
- `Todo` - Task management with title, description, optional due_date (YYYY-MM-DD), assigned_to (family member), completion status, and timestamps
- `DinnerPlan` - Meal planning with date, plan text, attendee_ids (JSON array of family member IDs), cook_id (family member ID), and timestamps. Multiple plans per date are allowed.

### Dependency Issues

```bash
install-deps            # Reinstall dependencies
```

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Using devenv commands
down                    # Stop container
build                   # Rebuild image
up                      # Start again

# Or use Docker directly:
docker stop rally
docker rm rally
docker build -t rally .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -v $(pwd)/output:/output --name rally rally
```
