Family: Parent 1, Parent 2, Child 1 (age 5), Child 2 (age 2)

We're a family that works hard, supports each other, and makes the most of every day.

Daily routines:
- Parent 1 wakes up at 6:00am for morning routine and exercise
- Child 1 wakes up at 6:30am and likes some playtime before school
- Parent 1 drives Child 1 to school at 7:45am
- Parent 2 does afternoon pickup at 3:00pm
- Dinner prep starts around 5:00pm - family dinner is our rally point
- Dinner is typically 5:30-6:00pm - when we come together and celebrate the day
- Bedtime routine starts at 7:30pm

Our approach to scheduling:
- Parent 1 works hybrid schedule with flexible daytime hours
- Parent 2 works from home with focused blocks for meetings and projects
- We maximize the school hours (8am-3pm) for focused work and errands
- Weeknight activities sometimes compete with dinner, but we coordinate
- Weekend mornings are for family activities

Weather considerations:
- Child 1 needs jacket for school recess when it's cold, sunscreen in summer
- We have frequent outdoor plans and activities
- Temperature changes matter for drop-off/pickup times
- Rain or snow can impact commute times - we plan ahead
- Hot days mean earlier outdoor activities

Our values:
- We work hard and support each other
- We're good citizens who honor our commitments
- We optimize our time and make things happen
- We celebrate wins and learn from challenges
- Family time is sacred - dinner and weekends are our anchors
